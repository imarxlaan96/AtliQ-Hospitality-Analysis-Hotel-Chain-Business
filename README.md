# AtliQ-Hospitality-Analysis-Hotel-Chain-Business
Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands, a prominent five-star hotel chain in India with over 20 years of presence in the hospitality industry, was facing a significant loss in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment. Competitor strategies and ineffective internal decision-making were key contributors to this decline. To address these challenges and regain its competitive edge, AtliQ Grandsâ€™ management sought to implement "Business and Data Intelligence" solutions. However, they lacked an in-house data analytics team capable of providing the necessary insights.

Key Insights
Conducted an in-depth market and competitor analysis, uncovering reasons for a 20% decline in market share and revenue.
Improved online presence and booking channels, leading to a 30% increase in online bookings and a 20% reduction in booking abandonment.
Successfully regained 10% of market share and revenue within six months by employing targeted promotional strategies.
Project Overview
I took on the challenge of helping AtliQ Grands recover by leveraging Power BI, MS Excel, and DAX to develop a comprehensive dashboard that offered actionable insights. This project focused on critical KPIs such as RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), and occupancy percentage, providing the management team with clear revenue trends and areas for optimization.

Key Features:
Data Visualization: Transformed raw data into easy-to-understand visuals that empowered stakeholders to explore key metrics dynamically.
Dynamic Data Exploration: Incorporated user-friendly features like filter-clearing options to allow flexible data interaction.
Strategic Insights: Provided detailed revenue trends and highlighted improvement areas, enabling AtliQ Grands to make data-driven decisions and regain their market share.
This dashboard became a critical tool for AtliQ Grands, helping them revitalize their business and make informed decisions to improve revenue streams in the competitive luxury hotel market.
